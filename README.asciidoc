AsciiDoc major mode for Emacs
=============================

This is my first attempt to write an Emacs major mode. I choose
AsciiDoc because it's a format I'm using, and I didn't like the only
major mode I found for it,
link:http://xpt.sourceforge.net/tools/doc-mode/[doc-mode]. I followed
an
link:http://web.archive.org/web/20070702002238/http://two-wugs.net/emacs/mode-tutorial.html[old
tutorial] and some other stuff I found on the net to improve the
highlighting of multi-line constructs.

It doesn't do a lot just yet, but I'll probably improve it when I
learn a bit more about Emacs major modes and I discover more things
I'd like to add to the mode. Suggestions and patches welcome ;-)
